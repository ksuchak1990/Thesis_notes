	abstract = {A widespread approach to investigating the dynamical behaviour of complex social systems is via agent-based models (ABMs). In this paper, we describe how such models can be dynamically calibrated using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), a standard method of data assimilation. Our goal is twofold. First, we want to present the EnKF in a simple setting for the benefit of ABM practitioners who are unfamiliar with it. Second, we want to illustrate to data assimilation experts the value of using such methods in the context of ABMs of complex social systems and the new challenges these types of model present. We work towards these goals within the context of a simple question of practical value: how many people are there in Leeds (or any other major city) right now? We build a hierarchy of exemplar models that we use to demonstrate how to apply the EnKF and calibrate these using open data of footfall counts in Leeds.},

	abstract = {The three critical measures of retail performance are often suggested to be “location, location, location”. However this generalisation, like many others in the literature, is of little practical use without underpinning empirical evidence. We report replications from mass observations of shopping behaviour in two categories, covering eight brands, competing in four location types and two countries. Our aim was to identify predictable behavioural norms between the key retail metrics; footfall density, shopper attraction and shopper conversion. Such evidence-based relationships, empirical generalisations, would then imply that the one number that matters is footfall, tentatively quantifying the retailers’ mantra. Our replications revealed surprising systematic regularities. Despite great differences in multiple conditions (base footfall, timings, brands, trading locations, frontage) attraction rates remained close to 4\% for each competing outlet with an average conversion rate of 43\%. Attraction patterns conformed to the well-known Law of Double Jeopardy (McPhee, 1963; Ehrenberg, Goodhardt \& Barwise, 1990), such that higher share brands attracted slightly more shoppers into store. Double Jeopardy was not so clear in the conversion ratio. Results therefore suggest a law-like relationship between footfall and retail sales that can be usefully applied in a wide range of circumstances.},

Another modification takes into account the finite amount of space that each vehicle needs.

	abstract = {This article is motivated by the practical problem of highway traffic estimation using velocity measurements from GPS enabled mobile devices such as cell phones. In order to simplify the estimation procedure, a velocity model for highway traffic is constructed, which results in a dynamical system in which the observation operator is linear. This article presents a new scalar hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) model for traffic velocity evolution on highways, based on the seminal Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) PDE for density. Equivalence of the solution of the new velocity PDE and the solution of the LWR PDE is shown for quadratic flux functions. Because this equivalence does not hold for general flux functions, a discretized model of velocity evolution based on the Godunov scheme applied to the LWR PDE is proposed. Using an explicit instantiation of the weak boundary conditions of the PDE, the discrete velocity evolution model is generalized to a network, thus making the model applicable to arbitrary highway networks. The resulting velocity model is a nonlinear and nondifferentiable discrete time dynamical system with a linear observation operator, for which a Monte Carlo based ensemble Kalman filtering data assimilation algorithm is applied. The model and estimation technique is evaluated with experimental data obtained from a large-scale field experiment known as Mobile Century, which is available for download at http://traffic.berkeley.edu.},

It is shown that the single-lane dynamics can be extended to the two-lane case without changing the basic properties of the model, which are known to be in good agreement with empirical single-vehicle data. Therefore it is possible to reproduce various empirically observed two-lane phenomena, like the synchronization of the lanes, without fine tuning of the model parameters.},

It addresses predictability from the theoretical to the practical, on timescales from days to decades. Topics such as the predictability of weather phenomena, coupled ocean-atmosphere systems and anthropogenic climate change are among those included. Ensemble systems for forecasting predictability are discussed extensively. Ed Lorenz, father of chaos theory, makes a contribution to theoretical analysis with a previously unpublished paper.

	abstract = {Agent-based models are increasingly used to address questions regarding real-world phenomena and mechanisms; therefore, the calibration of model parameters to certain data sets and patterns is often needed. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is an important part of the development and analysis of any simulation model. By exploring the sensitivity of model output to changes in parameters, we learn about the relative importance of the various mechanisms represented in the model and how robust the model output is to parameter uncertainty. These insights foster the understanding of models and their use for theory development and applications. Both steps of the model development cycle require massive repetitions of simulation runs with varying parameter values. To facilitate parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis for agent-based modellers, we show how to use a suite of important established methods. Because NetLogo and R are widely used in agent-based modelling and for statistical analyses, we use a simple model implemented in NetLogo as an example, packages in R that implement the respective methods, and the RNetLogo package, which links R and NetLogo. We briefly introduce each method and provide references for further reading. We then list the packages in R that may be used for implementing the methods, provide short code examples demonstrating how the methods can be applied in R, and present and discuss the corresponding outputs. The Supplementary Material includes full, adaptable code samples for using the presented methods with R and NetLogo. Our overall aim is to make agent-based modellers aware of existing methods and tools for parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis and to provide accessible tools for using these methods. In this way, we hope to contribute to establishing an advanced culture of relating agent-based models to data and patterns observed in real systems and to foster rigorous and structured analyses of agent-based models.},
